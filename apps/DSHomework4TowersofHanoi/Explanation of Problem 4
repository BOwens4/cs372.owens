This is my explanation for problem 4
There is absolutely no way i could get 100 or a 1000 disks to run in my computer, after 20, it does not work.
This is not a good idea to test, because after about 20 disks, the amount of moves becomes insanely high.
There are youtube videos of this game with below this amount of moves that exceed a couple hours long
recursive and iterative methods really work best with small increments, after you exceed that limit, it takes too
much processing power.
I also attached my graph to the docs folder in my github

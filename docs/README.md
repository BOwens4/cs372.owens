I am a team-oriented individual with development experience in C++, Python, and working with MatLab.  I am passionate about seeing a project evolve from idea inception to working deliverables.  I have patience in working through some of the most tedious tasks and have developed this skill through my passion for fishing and hunting, where patience is key.


I am a junior at Athens State, and this repository demonstrates some of the code that I have done throughout my course work at Athens. I mainly work in c++.

# Folder Structure

The folders in this repository are organized as such: 

The three top-level folders:
- `apps`: Applications go here.  A sample application named `listtest`
  is located in this folder and can be used as a template for
  assignments.
- `include`:  Header files will go here.  The `CMake` sample
  applications in the `apps` folder are setup to get the header files
  from this folder.
- `docs`: Here's where documentation such as this file will live.
  Certain assignments will ask you to collect and report data on the
  programs you've written.  Document that information in this folder.
